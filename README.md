# Beware All Ye Who Enter...

If you enter this branch, you will discover wonders beyond your wildest imagination, and also the most monstrous horrors of your nightmares.

Be wary. Do not trust what you see, for it may be a phantasm intent on devouring your very soul.

Tread carefully, for there are devious, and deadly traps that will keep you ensnared until your very wits are lost... or your life.
